# Real vs. AI-Generated Images

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the differences between real and AI-generated images. The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis steps to differentiate between real images and those generated by artificial intelligence.

## Contents

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Steps to load and preprocess the image data for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Visualization techniques to display and compare real and AI-generated images.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of a machine learning model to classify images as real or AI-generated.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluation metrics and results to assess the model's performance.
